Please follow the following instruction.

-  You don't need to explain anything, just give me full fixed code.
-  Use all the styles in inline 'style' attribute.
-  If you see we can get desired output using flex or grid instead of position absolute.
-  Make sure the code organized, also think about the layout if some class doesn't make any change to the layout or design effect just remove them.
-  If you see layout will never problem by using fixed value like width and height then remove it.
-  Make sure it pixel perfect design. By making pixel perfect design, do not use position/absolute just make sure spacing get perfect.
-  Don't use fixed width/height if really we don't need.
-  By using semantic html elements, make sure the layout will never problem.
-  Maintain CSS over-specification problem, it's happens when you apply redundant or unnecessarily specific CSS styles that could be achieved more efficiently by it parent element.
-  Do not keep absolute positioning if not necessary.
-  If you found helpful to use gap for flex box element then use it instead of margin
-  Removed unnecessary absolute positioning.
-  Used flexbox for aligning items.
-  Removed fixed width/height, allowing the container to be more responsive.
-  Added padding and margin to space elements appropriately. make sure our design should not break down.
-  Make sure you're use semantic html element and accessibility to ensure SEO friendly code.
